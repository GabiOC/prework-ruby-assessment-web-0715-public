# Prework Ruby Assessment

**Fork this repository, clone that fork, and open up the directory in terminal.**

In the `spec/` directory you'll find spec files. Go through them sequentially (starting with `000_array_spec.rb`). 

You can run each spec file individually as you work on each section:

`learn spec/000_arrays_spec.rb`

For tests 000-002:
* Code your solutions for the tests wherever you see a comment "write your code here!" or a '__' (note you will have to remove the ''). You will either be writing your solution within the test block or within the `expect()` part of the test. 

For tests 003-004:
* Find the corresponding file in the `lib/` directory and write your appropriate methods and classes. Note that the tests are looking for specific method names, so be sure to name your methods the same.

When you're finished (all of the tests pass and you're seeing green in your terminal):
* Stage the changes you made: `git add .`
* Commit those changes with a message: `git commit -m "all done"`
* Push those changed up to your fork: `git push origin master`
* Then open up a pull request on the original repository (that you cloned from)
